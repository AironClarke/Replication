                        We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our

                    <p>
                        Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live 
                        and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional 
                        backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are 
                        somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us 
                        has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape 
                        the future of music culture.

                        We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from 
                        building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to 
                        explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t 
                        always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are 
                        valued and openly encouraged.

                    Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported

                    their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music salons 
                    are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.

                    Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and your
